INTRO                                                           *impsort-intro*

|impsort| will sensibly sort your Python import lines, as well as highlight
imported objects.  "Sensibly" means that it will sort groups of imports
without moving them out of their original place in the file.

A similar utility named `isort` does the same thing, but is a little
destructive in doing so.  It tries to hoist almost all imports up to the top
of the file.  This is bad if you're modifying `sys.path` or need to do some
other import sorcery.

Highlighting doesn't have anything to do with the sorting.  It's simply nicety
that was easily achievable the existing code.  It's useful as a way to quickly
see if variables you're using is actually an import being shadowed.  This
includes names from a star import (see: |g:impsort_highlight_star_imports|).

COMMAND                                                       *impsort-command*

							*:ImpSort* *:ImpSort!*
:{range}ImpSort[!]	Run ImpSort on your Python script.  It accepts an
			optional {range} of lines to sort specifically, but
			any non-import lines in the range will be discarded.

			If [!] is present, "from ... import" lines will be
			grouped by the first module name and separated with
			spaces.

			Map it to your favorite key or run it in the command
			line yourself.  Endless possibilities!

						*:ImpSortAuto* *:ImpSortAuto!*
:ImpSortAuto[!]		Enables automatic sorting in the current buffer.
			Import sorting is performed after |InsertLeave| if the
			cursor is within an import region.  [!] has the same
			effect as in |:ImpSort!|.  After leaving insert mode
			and sorting, an attempt is made to put your cursor
			back on the word you left on.

			If called while automatic sorting is active, it will
			disable it instead.

			This is a fairly broad thing to enable, which is why
			it's per-buffer only.  A utility function
			*impsort#is_sorted()* is available to help you decide
			how and when to enable automatic sorting.

			An example script you would create in
			`after/ftplugin/python.vim`:
>
			if impsort#is_sorted()
			  ImpSortAuto!
			endif
<
			This script will check to see if the current python
			file's imports are already sorted before enabling
			automatic sort.  It's simple, but the ramifications of
			enabling this may not be clear to some users who just
			blindly enable options.  If this is something you want
			to enable on all python files, you will have to
			deliberately enable it yourself.


==============================================================================
CONFIG                                                         *impsort-config*

Though these use the |g:| prefix, the |b:| variants will be preferred if
they're present to allow you to have custom settings on a per-buffer basis.

						     *g:impsort_relative_last*
g:impsort_relative_last		If enabled, relative imports will be moved to
				the bottom of the import section.

				Default: `0`

						 *g:impsort_line_continuation*
g:impsort_line_continuation     If enabled, uses line continuations instead of
				parenthesis for wrapping import lines.
				See: |impsort-formatting|

				Default: `0`

						 *g:impsort_default_textwidth*
g:impsort_textwidth		The number of characters before wrapping an
				import line.
				See: |impsort-formatting|

				Default: |'textwidth'| or `79`

				Note: If set to an empty value, |'textwidth'|
				will be used.  If |'textwidth'| is also an
				empty value, `79` will be used.

						    *g:impsort_start_nextline*
g:impsort_start_nextline	If enabled, starts imported module names will
				start on the next line on "from...import"
				See: |impsort-formatting|

				Default: `0`

					       *g:impsort_override_formatexpr*
g:impsort_override_formatexpr	If enabled, overrides the formatexpr while
				typing on an import line.  Since |impsort|
				takes care of formatting, letting the default
				|'formatexpr'| wrap an import line as you're
				typing can be annoying.

				Default: `0`

				Note: This only applies while you're typing in
				insert mode.  Manual formatting with |gq| will
				work like it usually would.

				Note: This is a convenient option when using
				|:ImpSortAuto|.

						*g:impsort_highlight_imported*
g:impsort_highlight_imported	If enabled, highlights all imported objects in
				the buffer on |BufWinEnter| and |TextChanged|.

				Default: `1`

				Note: If asynchronous calls are not available,
				a simple highlighting method will be used
				based on imported names.

				The highlight group used for imported objects
				is |pythonImportedObject|.  By default, it is
				linked to the `Keyword` highlight group.

				If asynchronous calls are available, a more
				accurate parser is used to highlight imported
				functions, classes, and modules.
				See: |impsort-highlight|

					    *g:impsort_highlight_star_imports*
g:impsort_highlight_star_imports
				If enabled, `*` imports will be parsed in an
				external script to highlight objects from the
				module.

				Default: `0`

				Note: This option is ignored if asynchronous
				calls are available.

						  *g:impsort_allow_slow_parse*
g:impsort_allow_slow_parse	If enabled, a more accurate, but slower import
				parser is used.

				Default: `0`

				Note: This option is ignored if asynchronous
				calls are available.

				Note: This option is for testing purposes.
				You should not enable this option manually.
				If asynchronous calls are not available, there
				will be a significant delay while editing.

g:impsort_lines_after_imports	The number of blank lines that should follow a
				set of imports.  Imports preceeding module
				functions and classes will always be followed
				by two blank lines.

				Default: `1` (minimum)


Sort customization ~

There are a few variables that allow you to change the sort order of the
imports.  Each can take more than one sort method.  Each method is used in
order.  If one results in an equality, the next is tried.

See also: |impsort-methods|, |sort()|


						      *g:impsort_method_group*
g:impsort_method_group		A list of sort methods for a `group`.

				Default: >
				['length', 'alpha']
<
				A group is defined by the first component in
				the import (the root module).  For example:
>
				import os.path
				from os import path
<
				In both of the cases above, `os` is the
				`group`.  Leading dots (relative imports) are
				included in the group's name.

				Note: Since a `group` requires more than one
				import line from the same root module to be
				effectively sorted, groups that only contain
				one import line (let's call them `orphans`)
				are grouped together and placed above all of
				the other groups.  This is make it easier to
				see them when there are many imports involved.
				Additionally, if |:Impsort!| is used to add
				blank lines between the imports groups, the
				`orphans` would add a lot of unnecessary
				whitespace.  For example:
>
				from moduleA import thangs
				from moduleB import things
				from moduleA.thangs import things
<
				Would sort to:
>
				from moduleB import things
				from moduleA import thangs
				from moduleA.thangs import things
<

						     *g:impsort_method_module*
g:impsort_method_module		A list of sort methods for `modules` within a
				group.

				Default: >
				['depth', 'length', 'alpha']
<
				A module is the entire module path immediately
				after "import" or "from".  For example:
>
				import os.path
				from os import path
<
				The modules are "os.path" and "os",
				respectively.


						    *g:impsort_method_imports*
g:impsort_method_imports	A list of sort methods for imported objects.

				Default: >
				['alpha', 'length']
<
				This only affects "from ... import" lines.
				This option sorts the text after "import".
				For Example:
>
				from os import path
<
				In the example above "path" is the imported
				object.


Sort methods ~
							     *impsort-methods*

The following methods are available to use with the variables mentioned above.

alpha	  - Alphabetic sort.
depth	  - Module depth.  Basically how many dots are in the module path.
length	  - The length of a string.
|Funcref|   - A custom sort function.  See: |sort()|



Convenience function~

							  *impsort#sort_top()*
impsort#sort_top({pattern}, {a}, {b})
				This function takes a pattern and returns `1`
				or `-1` to keep it at the top of the sort.  If
				neither {a} or {b} matches or both matches the
				pattern, it returns `0` to allow the next
				method to determine the sort order.

				To keep things sorted to the bottom, you
				simply multiply the return value by `-1`.


Custom sort function ~
							 *impsort-custom-sort*

If you have different needs for sorting, you can use a |Funcref| to change
sorting criteria.  For example, if you wanted `django` to always be at the top
of the import section:

>
	function! s:django_sort(a, b) abort
	  return impsort#sort_top('^django', a:a, a:b)
	endfunction

	let g:impsort_method_group = [function('s:django_sort'), 'length',
		\ 'alpha']
	let g:impsort_method_module = [function('s:django_sort'), 'depth',
		\ 'length', 'alpha']
<

Note: |django-plus| has an option to enable this:
https://github.com/tweekmonster/django-plus.vim

HIGHLIGHTING                                                *impsort-highlight*

When |g:impsort_highlight_imported| is enabled, the following syntax groups
are used to highlight imported object names:

							*pythonImportedObject*
|pythonImportedObject| is the default syntax group for imported object names.
This group is linked to `Keyword`.  If asynchronous calls are available, this
syntax group will be used for imported object names that aren't covered by the
ones mentioned below.

						       *pythonImportedFuncDef*
|pythonImportedFuncDef| is used for imported functions.  This group is linked
to `Function`.

						      *pythonImportedClassDef*
|pythonImportedClassDef| is used for imported classes.  This group is linked
to `Class`.

							*pythonImportedModule*
|pythonImportedModule| is used for imported modules.  Unlike the previous two,
this group is linked to |pythonImportedObject| since distinguishing this may
not be that useful.


==============================================================================
SORTING                                                       *impsort-sorting*

|impsort| sorts sections of imports and separates them by origin.  A section
is a group of consecutive import lines.

Within each section, imports are sorted by origin:

1. Standard library
2. Third party (in site-packages)
3. local (basically imports not found in 1 and 2)

Each of these origins are separated by a blank line as suggested in PEP8.

Within each origin, the imports are sorted using the methods described in
|impsort-config|.


==============================================================================
NOTES                                                           *impsort-notes*

|impsort| doesn't care too much about syntax.  It searches for lines starting
with `import` or `from` and any number of lines immediately after it that are
blank or begin with indentation greater than the import line's.

For example: >

  from os import (
  	\ %

      ^path
<
|impsort| will consider all of the above to be an import line.  The only thing
that matters is that the following lines are blank or indented past the
initial import line.  Non-keyword characters are stripped from the text
(including commas) to normalize the text before parsing.  As a result, you get
a convenient side effect: You can add more objects to import anywhere within
those lines.

Example adding `mkdir` to the import:
>
  from os import (
  	\ %

      ^path mkdir
<
After running |:ImpSort|:
>
  from os import mkdir, path
<
The main convenience is that you don't have to worry about extra commas or
parenthesis that you may have yanked from another file.  Simply adding them
then sorting will be enough.  Additionally, with |:ImpSortAuto| enabled, the
line will be cleaned up and sorted automatically upon |InsertLeave|.


							  *impsort-formatting*
Formatting~

While limited, there are a few options that can help you maintain consistency
in existing code.

|g:impsort_line_continuation|

By default, |impsort| uses the parenthetical style for wrapping import lines.
This causes line continuation slashes to be used instead.

Example: >

  from module import LongImport1, LongImport2
<
After wrapping: >
  from module import LongImport1, \
      LongImport2
<

|g:impsort_textwidth|

Import lines are wrapped if they exceed a certain length.  By default,
|'textwidth'| is used.  You can use |g:impsort_textwidth| to set a textwidth
just for imports.  If a name would cause the line to exceed the width, a new
line is added.  If you want to have one import name per line, you can set this
to a low value (e.g. `1`).

Regardless of what this is set to, wrapped lines are always indented.

|g:impsort_start_nextline|

If this option is enabled, imports that would wrap start on the line
immediately after the import line.  For example: >

  from module import LongImport1
<
After wrapping: >

  # This will also cause a blank line to be added
  # after the closing parenthesis.
  from module import (
      LongImport1
  )

  # if g:impsort_line_continuation is enabled
  from module import \
      LongImport1
<
