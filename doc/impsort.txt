INTRO                                                           *impsort-intro*

|impsort| will sensibly sort your Python import lines.  "Sensibly" means that
it will sort groups of imports without moving them out of their original place
in the file.

A similar utility named `isort` does the same thing, but is a little
destructive in doing so.  It tries to hoist almost all imports up to the top
of the file.  This is bad if you're modifying `sys.path` or need to do some
other import sorcery.


==============================================================================
COMMAND                                                       *impsort-command*

								    *:ImpSort*
:{range}ImpSort		Run ImpSort on your Python script.  It accepts an
			optional {range} of lines to sort specifically, but
			any non-import lines in the range will be discarded.

			Map it to your favorite key or run it in the command
			line yourself.  Endless possibilities!
